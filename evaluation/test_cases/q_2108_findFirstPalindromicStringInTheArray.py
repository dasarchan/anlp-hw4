class Solution:
    """Given an array of strings `words`, return *the first **palindromic** string in the array*. If there is no such string, return *an **empty string*** `""`.

    A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
    Output: "ada"
    Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
    Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
    Output: "racecar"
    Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
    Output: ""
    Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
    * `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
    * `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
