class Solution:
    """You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string `"ababcc"` can be partitioned into `["abab", "cc"]`, but partitions such as `["aba", "bcc"]` or `["ab", "ab", "cc"]` are invalid.

    Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

    Return *a list of integers representing the size of these parts*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
    Output: [9,7,8]
    Explanation:
    The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
    This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
    A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
    Output: [10]
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 500`
    * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
