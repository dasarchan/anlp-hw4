class Solution:
    """Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return *the length of the longest substring of* `s` *such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to* `k`.

    if no such substring exists, return 0.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 10^{4}`
    * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
    * `1 <= k <= 10^{5}`
