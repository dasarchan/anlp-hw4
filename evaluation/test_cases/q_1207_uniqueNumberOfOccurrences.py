class Solution:
    """Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` *if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is **unique** or* `false` *otherwise*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
    Output: true
    Explanation:Â The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: arr = [1,2]
    Output: false
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
    Output: true
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
    * `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
