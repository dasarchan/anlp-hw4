class Solution:
    """Given two integers `n` and `k`, return *the* `k^{th}` *lexicographically smallest integer in the range* `[1, n]`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 13, k = 2
    Output: 10
    Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 1, k = 1
    Output: 1
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= k <= n <= 10^{9}`
