    "content": "Let's debug the provided code to identify and fix any issues.\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**:\n   - The code intends to calculate the minimum and maximum moves required to rearrange the stones such that there are no endpoint stones and they're in three consecutive positions.\n   - The code defines calculations for `move_penultimate` and `move_final` but appears to have initial logic or syntax issues, especially with the indentation.\n\n2. **Inspecting the Code**:\n   - Upon checking the `while` loop inside the `for` loop, I noticed there is a lack of indentation which would lead to a syntax error. The line `starting_index += 1` should be indented properly to be part of the `while` loop.\n\n3. **Debugging with PDB Commands**:\n   - While I cannot run the code directly in this environment, I will identify issues directly based on the reviewed logic.\n\n4. **Identifying Fixes**:\n   - Correcting indentation for the `while` loop.\n   - Revisiting the logic for `move_penultimate` and `move_final` to ensure that they accurately reflect the problem and computing the maximum possible moves correctly.\n\nNow, let's modify the code accordingly.\n\n```python\nFIXED_CODE\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numMovesStonesII(self, stones: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        stones.sort()\n        stone_length = len(stones)\n        move_penultimate = stones[-2] - stones[0] - stone_length + 2 \n        move_final = stones[-1] - stones[1] - stone_length + 2 \n        \n        most_moves = max(move_penultimate, move_final)\n        \n        if move_penultimate == 0 or move_final == 0: \n            min_legal_moves = min(2, most_moves)\n            return [min_legal_moves, most_moves]\n\n        max_legal_moves = 0 \n        starting_index = 0\n        \n        for index, stone in enumerate(stones):\n            while starting_index < stone_length and stones[starting_index] <= stone - stone_length:\n                starting_index += 1\n            max_legal_moves = min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), most_moves)\n        \n        return [stone_length - max_legal_moves, most_moves]\n\n# Test cases\nassert(Solution().numMovesStonesII(stones=[7, 4, 9]) == [1, 2])\nassert(Solution().numMovesStonesII(stones=[6, 5, 4, 3, 10]) == [2, 3])\n```\n\n### Overall Changes:\n- Ensured the correct indentation for `starting_index += 1`.\n- Added a boundary check in the `while` loop condition to prevent going out of bounds (`starting_index < stone_length`).\n\nThis code restructures the conditions properly to ensure correct logic and operation. You can test it to verify that it returns the expected outputs."
